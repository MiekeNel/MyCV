        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a fast learning individual, eager to face new challenges and broaden my field of experience. Problem solving is something I enjoy.
            I also enjoy being part of a team, I have excellent people skills and find it easy to communicate on all levels. I also take responsibility for my work and I work diligently to see all tasks through to completion.
            <br><br>
            I studied Mechatronic Engineering at SU and currently work as an Engineer in Training at Jacobs Clean Energy, doing projects for Koeber Nuclear Power Station.
            I am passionate about people, animals and nature and enjoy spending time in the ocean or the mountains.
            <br><br>
            As for my future, I am curious about a career in Controls & Instrumentation Engineering as well as Software Engineering.
